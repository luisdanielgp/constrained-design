                The PULI002 2019 project was the last edition of a 5 year program on which students from Chiba University, UNAM and Tec de Monterrey collaborated to generate proposals for future cities taking advantage of the benefits and potential
                of clean energy produced by hydrogen. The Swarm was the system proposed by Tec students, its features seek to create a clean and prepared-for-disaster environment in Mexico City that is also suitable for eco-touristic activities.

        <h2 class="fw4">CONTEXT</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy">
            <p>
                Mexico City has many problems and particular characteristics. The proposal designed for this project was meant to use the value of hydrogen to respond for the city needs in a future scenario placed in 2030.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, Mexico City is one of the most populated cities in the world, with at least 8 million inhabitants and 14 million tourist visits per year.
                The 2030 visualized scenario indicates an accelerated urban growth, rapidly wearing down city infrastructure. In addition, 75% of the CO2 emissions are produced by transportation with at least 4.7 million registered cars in the city.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="fw4">SYSTEM</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy">
            <p>
                An analysis of the city's issues and features was made to identify the ultimate value of hydrogen in the proposed system.
                It features different components that create a hyper-connected and self-sufficient system powered by hydrogen to build a harmonious environment that responds to the citizen's needs.

        <h2 class="fw4">PROCESS</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy">
            <p>
                The process of this project was divided in four main stages: workshop at Tec de Monterrey CCM, workshop at UNAM, workshop at Chiba University and finally a closing presentation at the mexican embassy in Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the beginning, each team developed their proposals by separate, and refined them through a series of activities including, forecasting, biomimicry, mockups, and constant iteration of each proposal.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of Tec team's proposal, the system components were defined and developed in many phases that allowed them to solidly integrate. Through this process, the design evolved, many renders, mockups and context explorations were made.
                This lead to the definition of a system inspired by the swarm.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="fw4">Swarm City</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy">
            <p>
                The swarm is the concept taken as the foundation of the proposed system. Inspired by nature, some of the characteristics are:
                the constant learning through receiving feedback from the context, the collective behavior that allows it to act as a whole,
                the modularity that prevents failure from shutting down the whole system and the distribution of tasks that enables efficiency and easy maintenance.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is a self-sufficient system, meaning that, every component works to provide everything it needs for its execution.
                It takes advantage from the swarm qualities to build a society with a sense of belonging and awareness of their environment.
