                If crop's variety dramatically decreases worldwide, sustainable options for maintaining good health should be sought. With this speculative excercise a food production dystopia is explored and the outcome invites us to think
                what the value of nutrition in society really is, and how enterprises may take advantage of new paradigms that come after the struggle.

            <p>
                The increase in homogeneity worldwide portends the establishment of a global standard food supply, which is relatively species-rich in regard to measured crops at the national level, but species-poor globally.
                Crop diversity is narrowing, threatening food security. Nations are more dependable of each other for food supply and genetic resources.

            <p>
                In order to analize this behaviour, we should take a look on the main drivers of food consumption as presented by John Kearney in his 2010 paper Food consumption trends and drivers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Income</li>
                <p>
                    As the global per-capita income raises at a rate of over 2 per cent per annum, higher fat diets will rise, especially in developing countries such as Mexico and Brazil
                    whose economies are expected to expand at twice the rate of industrial countries.
                </p>
                <li>Urbanization</li>
                <p>
                    In 1900 only 10 per cent of the population inhabited cities, today that figure is over 50 per cent. This results in a higher calorie intake as cities offer a greater range of food options.
                </p>
                <li>Trade liberalization</li>
                <p>
                    It has enabled greater availability and affordability of highly processed, calorie-rich, nutrient-poor foods and animal products in developing countries.
                </p>
                <li>Transnational food corporations</li>
                <p>
                    Traditional diets in developing countries are being transformed as more meals are now available in the fast-food, calorie-rich pattern of developed countries,
                    and these are increasingly abundant and cheap through advances in food processing and modern technology.
                </p>
                <li>Retailing</li>
                <p>
                    Supermarkets have affected the entire economy from farm to fork, they have allowed consumers to enjoy nutritional benefits with substantial improvements in the standards of
                    food quality and safety at competitive prices, however their existence may also lead to the increased availability of cheaper, less healthy food.
                </p>
                <li>Food industry marketing</li>
                <p>
                    This has a profound effect on food consumption patterns. As a matter of fact, many giant Transnational Food Corporations have launched aggressive marketing campaigns to penetrate consumer bases
                    in China, India, Brazil and Mexico, taking advantage of their increased disposebla incomes.
                </p>
                <li>Consumer attitudes and behaviour</li>
                <p>
                    While public interest in sustainability continues to rise and consumer attitudes are mainly positive, behavioural patterns are not always consistent with these attitudes. For example, the levels
                    of consumption seen by modern "Western" culture vastly exceed the minimum consumption level needed for survival.

        <h2 class="fw4">PROCESS</h2>

            <h2 class="fw4">Worldbuilding</h2>
            <p>
                Highly urbanized ecosystems are what people call home around the globe. Diet homogenization is at its peak, the main nutrition instrument is highly processed food.
                Corporations have taken almost every square meter of land for farming and processing factories, leaving no space for crop or livestock diversity.
            </p>
            <h3 class="fw5">The Microbiome Cult</h3>
            <p>
                It all started as an attempt to dissolve corporate control over mass nutrition as traditional meal diversity was no longer an option,
                the Microbiome Cult group of biohackers started a quest of developing DIY tech devices to modify human microbiome.
            </p>
            <p>
                The potential of these machines was quickly discovered by transnational companies that created sophisticated,
                mass-produced devices to provide the average household customer an entry into gut microbiota modification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, these corporations pushed a series of products that appealed to the customer's sense of belonging and celebrity worshipping trends. Buying famous people's microbiome replicas
                in order to self-perform transplants became a reality and a profitable business vertical.
            </p>
            <h2 class="fw4">Diegetic prototype</h2>
            <p>
                As the outcome of this research, speculation and worldbuilding project a diegetic prototype was produced. The Artificial Intestine intends to illustrate one of the first microbiome replicator and transplant mass-produced devices.
                Its main function is to maintain a bacterial culture that emulates the user microbiome. As the emulated culture is ready, modifications can be performed with the purpose of improving bacterial diversity. Once the culture is
                proven to be stable, the user can safely transplant it into himself by extracting the concentrate in capsules and swallowing them periodically for several days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prototype was built using 3D-printed parts, an acrylic pipe, an MDF case, a display, a PH sensor, a temperature sensor, a stepper motor and an arduino to power and control the electronic components.
                It was displayed as a part of the "Conclusiones" exposition at Tec de Monterrey CCM on November 2019. The project received good critique and even a couple of attendees believed it was a real product.
